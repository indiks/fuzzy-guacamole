  <h1>The Official Slow Food Manifesto</h1>
  <h2>x4</h2>
  <p>
    <div1>
      Approved by delegates from Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Denmark, France, Ger­many, Holland, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United States, and Venezuela at the founding conference of the International Slow Food Movement for the Defense of and the Right to Pleasure at the Opera Comlque In Paris on November g, 1989.
      <br>
      <br>Our century, which began and has developed under the insignia of industrial civilization, first invented the machine and then took it as its life model.
      <br>
      <br>We are enslaved by speed and have all succumbed to the same insidious virus: Fast Life, which disrupts our habits, pervades the pri­vacy of our homes and forces us to eat Fast Foods.
      <br>
      <br>To be worthy of the name, Homo sapiens should rid himself of speed before it reduces him to a species in danger of extinction.
      <br>
      <br>A firm defense of quiet material pleasure is the only way to oppose the universal folly of the Fast life.
      <br>
      <br>May suitable doses of guaranteed sensual pleasure and slow, long­lasting enjoyment preserve us from the contagion of the multitude who mistake frenzy for efficiency.
      <br>
      <br>Our defense should begin at the table with Slow Food. Let us redis­cover the flavors and savors of regional cooking and banish the degrading effects of Fast Food.
      <br>
      <br>In the name of productivity, Fast Life has changed our way of being and threatens our environment and our landscapes. So Slow Food is now the only truly progressive answer.
      <br>
      <br>That is what real culture is all about: developing taste rather than demeaning it. And what better way to set about this than an inter­national exchange of experiences, knowledge, and projects?
      <br>
      <br>Slow Food guarantees a better future.
      <br>
      <br>Slow Food is an idea that needs plenty of qualified supporters who can help turn this (slow) motion Into an international movement, with a little snail as its symbol.
